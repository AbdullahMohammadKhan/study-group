Deep Learning Study Group

This study group focuses on learning more about deep learning. It's split between two areas - 

* **Fundamentals**: We will work through academic textbooks and exercises so that we command strong theoretical foundations for neural networks and deep learning. Topics will cover calculus, algebra, probability, and computer science.
* **Applications**: We will develop hands-on experience building deep learning models. Initially, we’ll follow tutorials then we’ll move on to solving novel and illustrative data problems involving a broad range of techniques.

Initially, we'll focus on covering material in Michael Nielsen's book [Neural Networks and Deep Learning](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/).

# Schedule

## Week 1

* Read the [first chapter](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/chap1.html) of Michael Nielsen’s e-book and complete the exercises.
* [Install and configure TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r0.9/get_started/os_setup.html)
* Work through [this beginner TensorFlow tutorial](https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r0.9/tutorials/mnist/beginners/index.html) involving the MNIST data set, which is also discussed in Nielsen’s first chapter
* Clone this repository and add the material in a `week1` folder
