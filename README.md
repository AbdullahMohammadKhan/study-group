Deep Learning Study Group

This study group focuses on learning more about deep learning. It's split between two areas - 

* **Fundamentals**: We will work through academic textbooks and exercises so that we command strong theoretical foundations for neural networks and deep learning. Topics will cover calculus, algebra, probability, and computer science.
* **Applications**: We will develop hands-on experience building deep learning models. Initially, we’ll follow tutorials then we’ll move on to solving novel and illustrative data problems involving a broad range of techniques.

Initially, we'll focus on covering material in Michael Nielsen's book [Neural Networks and Deep Learning](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/).

# Session Notes

See the **weekly-work** subdirectories for what we cover each session, with rough notes. This is updated after each of our sessions, i.e., every third week.
