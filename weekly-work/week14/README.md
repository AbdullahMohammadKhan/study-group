# Session XIV: Reinforcement Learning

*Meeting date: October XXth, 2017* 

We're kicking off our coverage of the field of Reinforcement Learning with this session. 

<!--
A summary blog post, replete with photos of the session, can be found __[here](ADD LINK)__.

<!--
In addition to wrapping up the CS224N lectures (detailed notes from the final four lectures below), we enjoyed delightful presentations and discussions with: 

* [Marianne Monteiro](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mariannelinharesm/) on TensorFlow Recurrent Neural Network implementations that leverage [Estimators](https://www.tensorflow.org/extend/estimators) (see code and resources from her talk [here](https://github.com/mari-linhares/tensorflow-workshop/tree/master/workshops/Deep%20Learning%20Study%20Group%20NYC))
* [Druce Vertes](https://www.linkedin.com/in/drucevertes/) on predicting which financial stories go viral on social media (code [here](https://github.com/druce/deeplearning20170805))
