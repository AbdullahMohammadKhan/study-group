# Session XIII: Model Architectures for Answering Questions and Overcoming NLP Limits

*Meeting date: August __XX__, 2017* 

Lucky Session Numero 13 marks the end of our journey through the Stanford [Winter 2017 CS224N lectures](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL3FW7Lu3i5Jsnh1rnUwq_TcylNr7EkRe6) on *Natural Language Processing with Deep Learning*. This session marks the first anniversary of the Deep Learning Study Group, which held its first meeting on August 17th, 2016. Woot woot. 

A summary blog post, replete with photos of the session, can be found __[here](ADD LINK)__. In addition to discussing the content from four of the CS224N lectures (detailed notes below), we:
