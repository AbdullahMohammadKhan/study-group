# Session VIII: Autoencoders, Generative Adversarial Networks, Regularisation, & Venture Capital

*Meeting date: February 7th, 2017*

With this session, we wrapped up our coverage of CS231n (Stanford) lectures, which were delivered by now-familiar faces Andrej Karpathy and Justin Johnson as well as guest lecturer, Google Senior Fellow Jeff Dean. 

In addition, we were delighted to hear from guest speakers of our own: 

1. **[Raphaela Sapire](https://angel.co/raphaela-sapire)** on her experience as a venture capitalist at Blue Seed Capital, particularly her insight into the machine- and deep-learning start-up market (slides [here](https://github.com/the-deep-learners/study-group/blob/master/slides/2017-02-07__raphaela_sapire__billion_dollar_AI.pdf))
2. **[Katya Vasilaky](https://kathrynthegreat.github.io/)** on her research into L2 Regularization, the popular method to avoid overfitting in a wide range of models, including the deep-learning variety (slides [here]())

A summary blog post, replete with photos of the session, can be found HERE.
